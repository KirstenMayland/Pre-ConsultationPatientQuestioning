She is quite overweight and has a history of yo-yo dieting. She doesn\\'t exercise. She does not smoke. I don\\'t believe she sees the doctor very often. The ultrasound was given as she could not locate her IUD. The results of her Ultrasound revealed that she has an \"Adnexal mass\" on the left side, where her ovarian cancer was located decades prior. She had her ovary removed on that side as well as the fallopian tube. She still has her uterus and right ovary. The report states \"There is interval development of a left adnexal mass measuring 8.3 x 7.5 x 5.5 cm in demonstrating heterogeneous echotexture with internal vascularity.\" Further, the report states \"although a pedunculated fibroid is a possibility, no fibroid was demonstrated in this region in prior studies; a recurrent left ovarian malignancy must be excluded\" Also, that her uterus is anteverted, normal in size and appearance. Normal endometrial thickness as well. In my own past experience with a large fibroid, my uterus was greatly enlarged.  Under the \"Impressions\" section, they wrote \"Left adnexal mass which is incompletely characterized on the current study but recurrent ovarian neoplasm must be excluded. Recommend gynecology consultation and further evaluation with an urgent MRI of the pelvis\"  My question is, would an ultrasound be able to show if this was just a fibroid? Does the vascularity impact the seriousness of this mass? Also, can ovarian cancer recur in the same area, even without the ovary present? What aspects of a this type of mass signify risk of malignancy - is it vascularity? I myself had a massive fibroid years ago, but they could tell right away on ultrasound that it was, indeed, a fibroid.   Any insight would be greatly recommended. I am very scared for her and she is scared as well.', 'Hello, sorry to hear about your sister, fingers crossed it’s a benign diagnosis.  I’m not a gynaecologist, but I obviously work with them regularly.  To answer your questions  >\\tMy question is, would an ultrasound be able to show if this was just a fibroid?   Fibroids can appear as other masses on imaging. I’ve anaesthetised women for procedures to remove suspicious masses which were fibroids on histopathology.

My understanding is fibroids are generally not “internally vascular” on ultrasound.

Direct Local spread, lymph node metastases, residual disease.  >\\tWhat aspects of a this type of mass signify risk of malignancy - is it vascularity?  My understanding as above would be yes. Which is why they suggest MRI, usually the best imaging option for the pelvic organs.  All the best. Follow the advice of your sisters treating doctors, but ensure advocate for her health and that scans or appointments aren’t missed or unduly delayed.', 'Good answer, but I\\'d like to add one point:  > What aspects of a this type of mass signify risk of malignancy - is it vascularity?  Yes, but only as pertains to the specific characteristics in the ultrasound. Mainly it\\'s very suspect for malignancy because it\\'s quite big (8 cm) and completely new (\"interval development\"). I don\\'t know how long ago the last exam was, but it possibly grew pretty quickly, which is the main reason urgent further evaluation is advocated.  Benign cysts can obviously grow very quickly, because it\\'s just fluid accumulation, but solid tissue mostly does so when it\\'s malignant. Also there shouldn\\'t be anything here, not even a cyst - the ovary and salpinx were removed, after all.']\n",

They kept him on fluids overnight and over hydrated him (according to the doctor). They gave him miralax on Thursday and released him. Today, he woke up with a cough and had a temp of 100.3. We took him back to the ER and they did bloodwork and viral swab. Everything on the viral swab is negative. His temp has been normal since. I am attaching his bloodwork as it is concerning me. Does this look like sepsis to anybody? Idk if i'm googling too much but my anxiety is so high right now. Please let me know if you would suspect sepsis if this was your patient's bloodwork results.
