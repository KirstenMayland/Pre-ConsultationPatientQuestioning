My sister intentionally ate something she’s severely allergic to. She’s in a hospital but she resisted getting the EpiPen until she wasn’t conscious. She stopped breathing, someone did CPR. I don’t remember everything my dad said but I googled it and it doesn’t look good. please please tell me there’s a chance she’s going to be okay.

10 year old sister in the hospital,"My little sister is 10. She’s 4’6 and yesterday she was 48 pounds at the hospital. Shes been eating less and less but over the last week when my parents started to try and make her drink nutrition drinks she suddenly stopped having basically everything except water and then when she started refusing that too they took her to the ER. She kept saying she thought people were putting things in her food to make it more unhealthy. She thinks she’s fat, she’s not. She never was. She’s been so bad in the hospital that they’re giving her meds to make her stop fighting them. My dad said she’s not going to come home for a while because her kidneys were injured from what she was doing and her heart rate was 39-42 when she lays down. She’s getting things in an IV now but I don’t understand why they’re not making her eat or giving her a tube in her nose. My aunt had a tube in her nose when she wasn’t eating. I guess what I’m wondering is, first, how bad is this? She’ll get better right? Second, why aren’t they making her eat when she’s been there a whole day? Third, when she comes home will she be normal again, like can she get all the way better since she’s so young?

Multiple human bites on a 17f year old. Approximately 20 hours ago.,"The age of the person who bit them is a 9 and a half year old female. The 9 year old was throwing and attacking their mother and raging about killing them and the 17 year old tried to restrain her to protect their mom. The 9 year old proceeded to repeatedly bite and scratch at the 17 year old, chomping and shaking as hard as they could. Eventually the child calmed down and the mom took the older child to another room to photograph the injuries and provide comfort to the teen. The teen may have had a tetanus shot in the last 5 years, mom doesn’t remember exactly, but knows they had one. They have been at their wits end with the violent outbursts from the 9 year old, and the child actually just started menstruating this week for the first time, so that could be adding to her behavior problems. I’m concerned about my friend, her teen and the family in general and my friend is so overwhelmed she doesn’t know what she should do. Do these bites look concerning? The after photos are from 20 hours after the incident. I’ll put them in the comments.

I think my husband had a stroke but he won't believe me,"My husband [34M] and I [32F]went on our honeymoon to Japan in the beginning of February a year after we got married. We had a great time, especially my husband who drank 5+ beers every day on vacation mode. Our flight back was on Friday at 7PM so we had dinner at the airport and he had 3 beers before our flight. On the flight he ordered 3 more beers pretty early from takeoff when they serve the meal (1-2 hours from the first 3 drinks). Then, he had a xanax so he could pass out for the rest of the flight which was 12 hours. This was only his second time every taking a xanax and I've never taken it before. I don't know anything about drugs so I wasn't aware of any consequences. We arrived Friday at 5PM eastern time (in the states) and as we wanted to jump back to our time, he took an edible gummy to sleep.

He slept the entire night and entire morning the next day for a couple of days.. almost 20 hours a day and I noticed his speech was very slurred and his behavior seemed as if he was intoxicated when he was awake. A little too goofy and slurring and to be quite frank, annoying. He seemed confused at times too. For example, we had lunch with my brother and he went back to sleep and when I woke him up for dinner, he asked if we were eating with my brother. Another time we went out for lunch and had leftovers. We stopped by Publix to pick up something quickly and when we got back in the car, he asked me what was in the to-go box and couldn't remember where we ate less than an hour ago. I assumed he was sleeping a lot because of the jetlag and perhaps he was just tired, but I was still concerned because unlike him, I was sleeping a bit during the day but up at night so still sleeping only 8-9 hours at most. He also works remotely so he has a very flexible work schedule which allows him to sleep between meetings as work was slow for him when he got back. Whenever I brought up the concern, he would say it was just jetlag and he felt fine.

The following Wednesday, this behavior continued and that day I found out I was 4.5 weeks pregnant. We were having a honeymoon baby which was unplanned as I thought my ovulation date passed. In a normal situation this would have been a joyous moment for us, but when I told him the news after waking him up, he sounded intoxicated as usual and it made me very sad he wasn't fully there when I shared the news. I looked up some google articles and it said if you sleep 20 hours or more you can get sleep drunk which shows symptoms of the mind not fully being awake from sleeping too much and slurred sleep. That sounded like the issue, so I waited for his jetlag to go away.

A week passed and it was the weekend after we returned and that's when I started to get really worried as I was back to normal and he was definitely not as jetlagged, however, his slurring and intoxicated behavior were the same. I asked him if he drank or ate an edible and he denied both and I saw no evidence of it. He also shows these signs as soon as he wakes up, and it gets worse when he gets tired in the evenings. I started to google more things and was shocked to see how dangerous mixing xanax and alcohol was.. I immediately was concerned it was due to the xanax,,, but when I brought the concern up, he would argue and yell that he was fine and ask why I couldn't believe him when he said he was completely normal and felt like himself. However, as an onlooker, I wish I was wrong, but I'm sad he won't believe me that he's not ok. I told him this, and he told me I was just annoyed because I hate when he's drunk and because my hormones are crazy from the pregnancy. I was so hurt by his words I could feel my heart beating like crazy and I cried in a room by myself. I just assumed it was the drug and hoped it would pass out of his system. As I didn't want to fight and be yelled at and be stressed out with my pregnancy, I let it go and said I would give him 1 more week for it to pass his system.

It is now almost 2 weeks in and as I've been even more nervous and anxious because nothing has gotten better... The more I google now, I'm convinced he had a stroke and more stressed because we didn't go to the hospital sooner. My husband barely gets 1000 steps a day as he works at home, he likes to eat out and eat unhealthy (however not overweight as he is 5'10 and only 160lbs), and he likes to drink on a regular base. His sleep schedule is back to normal but he's still slurring, slow, and his eyes are still droopy. I'm wondering the xanax combination with the alcohol did something to prompt a stroke in his sleep which went unnoticed due to his jetlag.

I'm scared the damage is permanent now and this is what the father of my child will be like, permanently intoxicated behavior... I am so stressed and I have conveyed this to my husband but all I get is yelled at.. I feel like he will leave me if I push him further but I care too much about him to let this just go like I did the past two weeks. I've got so desperate I've reached out to his best friend to intervene and talk to him and convince him to go to the hospital. I am unbelievably sad that me caring for him isn't enough for him to try to figure something out and just deny that anything is wrong and that I'm the problem. I even told him me being stressed could affect our baby and him not being logical to even see that this is actually a problem is confirming his mind is not there. I want my husband back.. I want him to be present and actually be with me and enjoy pregnancy and parenthood together.. I don't know what to do..",How do I feel about my migraines?,1) How old are you?
Pregnant and anorexic,"I’m a 19 year old female. I’m 5’6 and I weigh 94 pounds. I’m anorexic, I have been since I was 17. I’m not diagnosed, but it’s obvious. I know. I’ve lost 48 pounds in a year and a half by cutting my calories to 750 a day and walking literally everywhere.

And I’m pregnant. I’m looking at 2 positive tests. I didn’t even know I could get pregnant, I haven’t had a period in 7 months. Please don’t lecture me about safe sex, it’s not what you think. I’m not irresponsible. I didn’t…choose this.

My sister thinks most food is poison,"My sister is 10. I’ve been worried about her getting skinnier and eating weird for a while and at her physical Monday my mom said the doctor is concerned too because she’s 4’6 and she’s 52 pounds and not on her chart anymore. My sister wouldn’t say anything about not eating though and just said she doesn’t like the foods. The doctor prescribed shakes for her to drink and she’s supposed to come back in a week to get checked again but she’s refusing to drink them because she says they have seed oils. She’s pretty much refusing to eat anything that is processed and isn’t “natural”. She’s especially scared the seed oils and food dyes, but also “processed stuff”. She watched a bunch of videos on YouTube I think that scared her. Well my parents are just trying to get anything in her so they’re giving in but I feel like letting her not eat stuff because she thinks it’s “poison” will only make her think that more.

My question is I was hoping someone could explain why seed oils and dyes aren’t poison, and why it’s okay to have them and they won’t hurt you. She says she saw videos of doctors saying it was true but I know it can’t be and it’s definitely not good to only eat things that come out of the ground. Also can someone maybe explain what can happen when you don’t eat enough and you don’t eat seed oils and things. I want to show this to her.

Severe Reaction to First Dose of Lexapro—Norovirus or Side Effect?,"Male 30 years old, 6Ft 145lbs.

Took 5mg of Lexapro for the first time at 8PM—by midnight, I was nonstop vomiting, had diarrhea all the next day, and had to go to the ER for IV fluids since I couldn’t even keep down water. Doctors blamed it on norovirus, but none of my friends or girlfriend (who ate the same food) got sick.

It’s been 48 hours, and I’m finally feeling better, but I’m terrified to try Lexapro again. Could it have been a reaction, maybe with my GERD meds (rabeprazole, Pepcid)?

"12 year old - incontinence, sleeping all day, black outs, pain in stomach,feeling sick all day and now these on her feet.","Hi, my daughter has been having a really rough time lately and the GP does not know what to do. I feel like we've just waited and waited for appointments.

10 years of age she started feeling sick, dizzy and needed to lie down all the time. We was seen and told it was anxiety over a bad ankle break while she was at school, she was forced to walk on her ankle for over an hour by first aid.

11 years of age she started wetting herself (never had a problem since potty training)

12 years of age all she is doing is sleeping lying down saying she feels sick she looks incredibly pale and has started blacking out. 3 months ago her whole side of her face swelled up and she complained about a lump in her neck. This was checked out with and ultra sound and we was told she has slight larger lymphnode but it was nothing to worry about.

We have had blood tests done for over 3 years , the only thing that has stuck out was the last one done on January 28th with low iron and signs of and infection , she was given feredet. The next blood test results came back normal. There has been no indication of bladder infection in urine tests either.

The newest is now this with her feet she has dark patches and white patches of skin on her feet. I think the white ones are fat nodules? The dark ones are causing her pain though.

Long frustrating illness suddenly popping up new symptoms,"Female, 30 years old, 210lb

So almost a month ago I started getting sick with flu like symptoms. Fever, crackling cough, body aches. I became concerned when the fevers were spiking up to 103°F and the next night 104°F and still had consistent fevers over 101°F after 6 days.

I went to my Dr and after discussing that my housemate was just getting over pneumonia he decided to prescribe me antibiotics. Within a day of taking the antibiotics my fevers went away and I started improving. Completed the full 5 day course of antibiotics. About 5 days after my last dose(so about 10 days ago) I felt like I had a relapse with my cough. Just a persistent cough with a little bit of crackling and coughing up mucus, but nothing so I didn't think much of it.

Now today I felt like my tonsils were a swollen so I looked in the back of my throat and they are a little swollen and covered in white spots! I have maybe a tiny bit of pain in my throat but it's very mild and I figured just from the coughing. My throat looks a little irritated but is not bright red or as painful as you'd usually expect with strep. Also no fever. I looked at oral thrush as well and it doesn't really match what I saw? It's definitely which splotches, not an all over film and it is on just my tonsils, nowhere else in my mouth.

I'm going to call my Dr first in the morning and see if I can make an appointment, but I'm a worrier and just wondering if anyone has any idea what this might be or at least some reassurance this is normal?

Surgeon said I was so anxious they struggled to anaesthetise me,"Last week I (40F) had a brachioplasty to remove a tonne of loose skin after weight loss. It was my seventh general anaesthetic in life (they've all been for relatively minor things) and as it was an elective surgery I remember feeling ok being on the tolley, in the room next to theatre where they put the cannula in you.

They gave me the initial relaxant stuff that makes you feel good n high, and I was talking to the two anaesthetists normally.

After the operation the surgeon came and told me that when they took me into theatre I got extremely anxious, on the verge of a panic attack and raving about potentially having a stroke. (I'm normal BMI, good health, no health issues that would make this likely). He wanted to reassure me that nothing bad happened.

He said they had to give me more proform? (I think) and I kept raving right up until I was intubated. The surgeon said that when I came round I was extremely distressed and in more pain than would be expected.

I dont remember any of this and am shocked. I'm worried that if I ever need to be put to sleep again my subconscious will bring this up and make it harder for the doctors. My questions are:

"Cannot pass gas at all, doctors dumbfounded","Hi, english is not my first language so I apologise if the post is hard to follow. I've (M31) had this problem for about 3 years and it's steadily been getting worse. At first it became harder to pass gas, I was getting bloated more frequently and had to assume certain positions to be able to get gasses out. Today I'm bloated 24/7 with a constant pain in my left abdomen (at the end of my colon).

I've done a colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy (?), the other one where a tube is inserted down the throat and through the stomach, MRI, colon-transit (with markers), X-ray while defecating, I've seen a dietist, done physical therapy, tried pretty much every possible medication and more.

The one problem doctors have been able to find is that my puborectalis-muscle is somewhat contracted, it's not relaxing as it should and making defecation harder. Despite this, I've also been told that this doesn't explain why my colon is retaining so much gas. I don't have Chrons or an ibd, no excess bacteria. Exercise pushes the gasses forward but it never gets past that one point and causes a lot of pain instead. If I stop eating the gasses get permanently stuck and I look pregnant.

This problem has turned my life upside-down, I'm not going out with friends anymore, I can't take care of my household, it's straining my relationship with my girlfriend and making it really hard to be a good father to my young son.

It's the worst right after doing no 2, and for several hours after it's as if my colon is completely blocked. It feels like my colon is folded, and in order to pass gas I need to find a position where I can get it straight enough to allow gasses to pass through, and even then I'm rarely successful. The more bloated I get the worse the pain becomes, it's always present down in my left abdomen and I'm convinced that it's because something is causing a blockage at that exact spot.

I had an apendectomy about 12 years ago and otherwise I'm completely healthy. I have a varied diet and exercise as much as I still can despite the pain. I don't drink and haven't smoked for 10 years.

"How obvious would it be that somethings wrong, if a baby is exposed to drugs?","Let me first state that I do not do drugs, and I do not want my child near drugs, but without proof, I may not have a choice.

Age 13 months, male, 26 inches, 18 pounds, he obviously doesn't smoke, no medicine besides occasional tylenol and motrin, no diagnosis.

His dad is fighting for custody, but he smokes meth in his home, daily. He smokes in his bedroom, where he says his child wouldn't be allowed in, and thinks that makes it okay, but I know it seeps into the walls and all that.

Anyway, I saw a show where this baby that lived in a meth house was nonstop screaming, due to withdrawals. So would it always be that obvious, or could he have a small amount of drugs in his system, and it go unnoticed??

If he has to go with his dad, I was thinking I could buy an over the counter piss test and test him as soon as I get him back, just in case. But still, I want to know if it could go easily unnoticed, depending on how much is in his system.

Right now he's with me, and not exposed to anything, I'm just trying to prepare ahead.

I went into the ER with urinary and kidney symptoms—I left with an STD,"To clarify—I did not contract an STD in the ER lol. Also-my original post was deleted due to lack of info.

I’m 30F, 5’8”, 190lbs, non smoker, no meds.

I’m hoping someone with some knowledge can help me understand what’s going on here. Like the title says, I went in with bad urinary symptoms. After some testing, turns out I had no urinary infection, but I did have kidney stones. As I’m being discharged with antibiotics and whatnot, the NP asked me to come into her office to discuss something privately. I found this odd since I had my own private room in the ER, but I went with her anyway. She then told me I tested positive for an STD (trichomonas). I was so confused because I’m in a committed marriage and haven’t have another sexual partner in almost a decade. I expressed this and she said “that’s a conversation for you and your husband”. While in disbelief, I went through all the stages of grief in her office and the started asking questions. For example, I’ve been in the hospital A LOT since last June and have had 6 surgeries since October. I asked if I could have contracted this by being in the hospital, having many surgeries (with urinary catheters each time), etc. She assured me “you can only contract this by intercourse. There is no other possibility.” I kept pressing for any other possible explanation and all she had to offer was “I was with a partner for over a decade and found out he had another family, men can and will hide anything. If he tells you he hasn’t cheated, he’s gaslighting you.” She was very adamant. We spoke for a while and I ended up sitting there in tears over the news that my family just fell apart. She offered emotional support and gave me advice on how to approach the conversation with my husband. Once discharged, I went home and talked to my bff about it all and came up with a plan for how to address it. I’ve never been in a situation like this before. I was so scared, betrayed, hurt, pissed off, etc. Later on, I confronted my husband and asked for a divorce. He assured me he has not been with anyone since we’ve been together. Based on his body language, his words, and the way he was acting, I 100% believe he’s telling the truth as much as I didn’t think I would believe him. He went and got tested same day (results take up to 14 days to come back for males for some reason). He swears he’s never been with anyone else. I know I haven’t either. After we talked, we started reading about it online. Reputable sources say that sexual interaction is not the only way to contract this, in fact, it’s very common to contract this from a dirty toilet seat, uncleaned sex toy, urinary catheters, hospital admissions, using a damp towel, things like that. They say this infection is from a parasite so I guess it makes sense you can pick it up anywhere if that’s true.

So currently, I’m being treated with antibiotics. We’re awaiting his results. Does anyone have any insight on this? Anyone dealt with something like this? I don’t know what to believe. What are the possibilities I picked this up from being an inpatient in the hospital or from a towel or toilet seat? Give it to me straight Reddit. We have a family and I hope the ER NP was wrong.

I’m crying from the pain every night and I can’t sleep. I limp everywhere and I can’t do any of the things I used to enjoy doing. This is a last resort I don’t know what to do. I’ve been icing it, compressing it, elevating and resting for months. I wear running shoes even in the snow but it isn’t getting better. Does anyone know what is happening? I’m in so much pain and there was so injury preceding this I was simply walking on smooth, flat linoleum on the first floor in my school building…

Please help super anxious,"I'm 21F and was taking my sertraline 250 mg inconsistently. Once i got back on tjem consistently, i have been dealing with small body jerks but only at rest so when i'm laying down watching tv or even sometimes sitting. They're very small so not too noticeable to others, but I can feel them. Online it says that myoclonic jerks are usually related to something serious and hypnic jerks are only while you're about to fall asleep. Why is this happening? Is it something serious? I have health ocd too so it's worrying me. My thumb also twitches in certain positions

2 Rare ANA Patterns?,"I recently (4 days ago) had some blood work done where my ANA was checked and got hit with some weird results. There was Midbody (AC 25) and Spindle Fibre (AC 27) patterns both at 1:180 titre. While I was able to find information on both individually I was not able to find anything on the co-occurrence of the two and the implications from that.

Background: -early 20’s, Female, Indian decent (resides in Canada), 5’0ft, 135lbs -Diagnosed Celiac disease (not recent), gluten free diet for over a year -Diagnosed ADHD, on 30 mg Vyvanse (started 3 weeks ago) -Father with miositosis, pancreatic cancer, as well as a “unknown autoimmune condition”, also 2 recent (1-3 years) ANA has come back negative, no data from when he was diagnosed with miositosis

Symptoms: -joint issues (mild and primarily leg) -muscle weakness -headaches, fatigue, nausea -episodes of confusion and dizziness (started 5 months ago happens once a month, longer duration each time (2 mins - 8 mins) -weight fluctuations -bunch of other small weird symptoms I can think of right now

Clinical Findings: -all blood work relatively normal -during pelvic/transvag ultrasound (referred for period pains) kidneys were imaged, right 9.9 cm left 9.5 cm -only significant finding was leukocytes in urine (250) and squamous/transitional epithelial cells (6-10), method was clean catch, not bacteria present (tested around December 2024, will update as I have the requisition but haven’t had the time to go) -everything else was normal but if u need specifications or are curious please as me for specific results and I will provide if I have them

Honestly have no idea where to go from here as I am waiting for a call back from my doctor so any advice would be appreciated. Drop what ever further testing/outcomes it could be.",What is the last time I had elevated LFT’s?,1) Is there any way you could re-test the LFT?
